AI applied to things change things how work

Below is a battle-tested roadmap you can follow to ship an app that lets users sign in with their Google account and ingest the entire contents of their Gmail mailbox.  At a high level you (1) register and verify a Google Cloud project, (2) implement the OAuth 2.0 “Authorization-code + refresh token” flow with Google Identity Services, (3) call the Gmail API to pull messages, and (4) keep the mailbox in sync with incremental history IDs and Pub/Sub push notifications.

⸻

1  Architecture & high-level flow
	1.	Client (web/mobile/desktop)
	•	Launches Google Identity Services (GIS) sign-in button → obtains an authorization code with the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly scope.  ￼
	2.	Backend service (Node.js, Go, Python, etc.)
	•	Exchanges the code for an access token (1-hour lifetime) and refresh token (long-lived) using OAuth 2.0 token endpoint.  ￼
	•	Stores tokens securely (DB or secrets manager).
	3.	Data synchronizer
	•	Uses the Gmail API to page through users.messages.list until the full mailbox is local.  ￼
	•	Persists the historyId from each response for incremental syncs.
	•	Registers a watch request so Gmail pushes change notifications to a Cloud Pub/Sub topic; on each push it calls users.history.list starting from the last stored historyId to fetch deltas.  ￼ ￼

	Step
Action
1
Create a Google Cloud project and enable â€œGmail APIâ€ and â€œCloud Pub/Sub APIâ€.
2
Configure OAuth consent screen â†’ external application â†’ add Gmail scopes you need (gmail.readonly is enough for reading; request broader scopes only if you truly need them).Â 
3
Create OAuth 2.0 client IDs (Web, Android, iOS, Desktop). Download the JSON client secrets for server-side use.
4
Add a verified domain and production status; otherwise refresh tokens issued while in Testing expire after 7 days.Â 



Clien side authentication
<script src="https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client" async defer></script>
<div id="g_id_signin"></div>
<script>
google.accounts.id.initialize({
  client_id: '<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>',
  callback: ({ code }) => fetch('/auth/google', { 
     method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({ code })
  });
});
google.accounts.id.renderButton(
  document.getElementById('g_id_signin'),
  { theme: 'outline', type: 'standard' }
);
</script>

	•	Set access_type: 'offline' and prompt: 'consent' to ensure you obtain a refresh token on first sign-in.  ￼

4  Backend token exchange & storage

Example (Node.js using the official google-api-nodejs-client):


import { google } from 'googleapis';
const oauth2 = new google.auth.OAuth2(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT);
const { tokens } = await oauth2.getToken(code);   // exchange code
// tokens = { access_token, refresh_token, expiry_date }
storeTokens(userId, tokens);                      // encrypt at rest
oauth2.setCredentials(tokens);                    // ready to call Gmail API

Token hygiene – monitor invalid_grant errors and prompt the user to re-consent if a refresh token is revoked or has lapsed.  ￼

⸻

5  Initial mailbox import
	1.	users.messages.list with maxResults=500 until nextPageToken is empty.  ￼
	2.	For each ID, call users.messages.get with format=full or metadata depending on how much data you need.  ￼
	3.	Save the highest historyId returned in the last page.

Tip: Community modules such as node-gmail-api batch list+get into a single call to reduce quota consumption.  ￼

⸻

6  Keeping the mailbox in sync
	1.	Create a Pub/Sub topic and grant the Gmail system service account the Publisher role.
	2.	users.watch with your topic name and optional labelIds filters. Gmail sends JSON notifications that include a new historyId.  ￼
	3.	Your worker pulls the Pub/Sub message, then calls users.history.list?startHistoryId=<lastId> to fetch inserts/deletes/label changes.  ￼
	4.	If Gmail returns 404 (history gap) or the stored ID is too old, fall back to a full resync.  ￼

Medium deep-dives describe practical pitfalls (missing messages, duplicate IDs) and work-arounds.  ￼

⸻

7  Quotas, back-off and performance
	•	Per-user: 15 000 quota units/minute; each messages.get = 1 unit; watch = 1 000 units.  ￼
	•	Respect the Retry-After header and exponential back-off on 429/403 userRateLimitExceeded.  ￼
	•	For high-volume pulls, use batching (up to 100 calls per HTTP request) or partial-response (fields=) to trim payload.

⸻

8  Refresh-token lifecycle & re-auth
	•	Tokens created while your app is in Testing expire after 7 days; move to In production for indefinite refresh tokens.  ￼
	•	Even production refresh tokens can be revoked by the user or Google security checks—always handle 400 invalid_grant.  ￼
	•	Rotate encryption keys periodically or store tokens in Secret Manager with automatic expiration policies.  ￼

9  Security & compliance checklist


Area
Recommendation
Token storage
AES-256 encrypted column in DB or Secret Manager; never log raw tokens.Â 
Least-privilege
Start with gmail.readonly; request broader scopes only when a feature truly needs it.Â 
User deletion
Honor data-deletion requests; delete local cache and revoke token via oauth2.revoke.
App verification
If you access â€œSensitiveâ€ or â€œRestrictedâ€ scopes, complete Googleâ€™s security assessment before launch.

10  Skeleton project structure (Node.js example)


/api
  auth.routes.ts          // POST /auth/google
  gmail.importer.ts       // initial full sync worker
  gmail.sync.ts           // Pub/Sub push handler
/client
  App.tsx                 // React SPA w/ GIS button
/scripts
  setupPubSub.ts          // one-time infra automation

  The open-source sample gmail-quickstart plus the official google-api-nodejs-client give working boilerplates you can adapt.  ￼ ￼

⸻

Next steps
	1.	Scaffold the project and get a token exchange working end-to-end.
	2.	Run a full mailbox import for a single test account and validate storage schema.
	3.	Enable Pub/Sub watch and verify incremental updates.
	4.	Harden for production—quota monitoring, secret rotation, verification, and user deletion flows.

Follow this plan and you’ll have a scalable, compliant Gmail-powered application that keeps user mailboxes mirrored in near-real-time.
