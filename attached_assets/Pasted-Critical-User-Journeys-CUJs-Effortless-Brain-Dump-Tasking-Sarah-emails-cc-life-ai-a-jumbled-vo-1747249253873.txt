Critical User Journeys (CUJs):
Effortless Brain Dump & Tasking: Sarah emails cc@life.ai a jumbled voice note, PDFs or typed thought: "Remember to prep for the Project Phoenix review, ask finance about Q3 numbers, and pick up milk." CC intelligently parses this into actionable to-dos, calendar reminders, and flags key entities.
Inbox Domination & Smart Reply: Josh gets a complex client email with multiple stakeholders CC'd. He forwards it to cc@life.ai (or CCs it initially). CC:
Summarizes the thread and key action items.
Drafts a personalized reply in Josh's style, considering past interactions and sentiment.
Suggests, "This seems urgent. Want me to flag for follow-up if no reply by EOD?"
Q


Proactive Context & Synthesis: Maria is about to email a new important contact. She sends an email to cc on the matter who (via a lightweight Gmail extension or by being CC'd on the draft) proactively surfaces with a draft:
Past (public or shared) interactions with this person or their organization.
Key talking points based on Maria's recent work.
A "dot connect" insight: "This person recently mentioned interest in X, which aligns with your Project Y."
Natural Language Gmail Control: David emails cc@life.ai: "Archive all newsletters older than 7 days. And find that presentation I sent to marketing last month about the Q4 strategy." CC executes these commands via the Gmail API.
Natural Language Gmail Control: David forwards an email: I really don’t like thi sort of email. Lets keep an eye on them, but don’t surface them unless urgent. Also, can you scan my emails for anything I missed today? Especially from sundar.
Seamless Onboarding & Viral Growth: New users simply start emailing or CC'ing cc@life.ai. When CC'd on a thread, CC can subtly introduce its capabilities, making discovery organic and viral.
Proposal:
CC: Your Life AI is an intelligent assistant, primarily accessed by emailing/CC'ing it (cc@life.ai or an enterprise equivalent like cc@yourcompany.com), that deeply integrates with Gmail to become your indispensable partner for managing communications, tasks, and knowledge. You can upgrade it to a real webapp or app, but it’s primarily an entity to actively invoke, from within GMail.
Your Inbox AI: Lives within your email. No new app to download or learn initially. It works on your inbox (organizing, labeling, archiving) and with you (drafting, summarizing, reminding).
Personalized Context Engine: CC builds a dynamic, private understanding of your communication patterns, social graph (weighted by importance/frequency), priorities, and personal style by analyzing your interactions and (with permission) your email history via the Gmail API. It tracks sentiment and relationship nuances. It also has a view into your calendar and Chat for context, thought the primary objective is GMail. It always operates with FULL CONTEXT of your prior interactions.
Action & Automation Hub (GTD formula):
Manages tasks, notes, ideas, and reminders emailed directly or CC'd to it.
Provides "Todo & Next Step," "Awaiting Response," "Read Later" categorization. Offers the next steps even
Drafts replies, summarizes threads, ideates solutions, and connects dots across disparate information.
Executes powerful, bulk Gmail operations through simple natural language commands that it can remember and learn from and make scheduled.
Programmable & Adaptive (Product RL): Users can guide CC's tone and behavior over time ("be more concise," "prioritize emails from my manager"). CC employs a "Product RL" (Reinforcement Learning from user interaction & feedback) framework, making it a self-improving system that gets more valuable with every interaction and model upgrade. It’s a "Contextualizer" that truly learns you. This is all done via System Instruction. Uses labels and tags to enqueue up emails for review with you
Future Vision: Evolves with optional web/mobile interfaces for richer, bespoke interactions (e.g., "upgrading" an email from CC to a live chat/doc). Integrates with Calendar, Drive, Chat, and other essential services. Offers specialized "personas" (e.g., legal.cc@, travel.cc@).
